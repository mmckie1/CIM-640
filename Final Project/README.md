<h2>What is it or for?</h2>
This web application would give children 5-10 years old a fun and interactive way to learn how to read. I endeavor to show children that the key to unlocking their imagination is through reading. 
<h2>Why does it need to exist?</h2>
This web application needs to exist because with the change in technology over the years there has been a shift in how children learn.  Children are stimulated by different technology driven learning aids. This program would show them that by just reading, they could potentially speak anything into existence.   
<h2>Where would it be displayed?</h2>
This would be a on-line program that they could play.  
<h2>When will it be viewed?</h2>
It would be viewed whenever a person logs-on to the site. 
<h2>How will you execute it?</h2>

Code Plan
The design for this program would imitate the look of a book.. 
When the user first begins the simulation they be prompted to "Click start to  begin reading!". Underneath prompt will be a "start" button.
When user clicks the "start" button -> the canvas will be split in two.
Left side of the canvas will be for PageText and RightSide of the canvas will be for animation. 
By using the p5.speech library the user will be able to read out loud the PageText and a key words within the PageText would cause the image on RightSide of the canvas to animate.
When user is ready to go to the next page they would click the "next" button 
</ul>
